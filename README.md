# MapPointsApp

My Maps Point is a web application built to practice and learn [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) technologies. The user can interact with the World Map and add, list, or delete points with geolocation.

My main focus in this project was to learn about:
- Routing between pages
- Build components, layouts, interfaces and services
- CRUD methods (to create, delete and show a single point or a list of points)
- input with forms
- mark points in the map using [MapBox SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), using [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as Non-Relational Database
- styling the project with the CSS Framework [Material Angular](https://material.angular.io/)


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.
